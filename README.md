<p align="center">'Round the beggar from Varassa all sat in a ring, <br />and by the campfire they sat and heard his song. <br />About walkers and wolfkin and every terrible thing, <br />and of his fear he sang to them all night long:</p>
<p align="center"><em>"There is something beyond the mountains, <br />beyond the howls beyond the mist, <br />there is something behind the veils, <br />behind hearts cold as stone. <br />Hearken, something walks and whispers, <br />walks and lures you in and whimpers: <br />Come to us, for this earth shall ever be ours and ours alone!"</em></p>

    -   Integrated consumables roll mechanics.
    -   Automation through Roll Modifiers and Encumbrance tracking.

    -   Bring the party together on Journeys. @maxstar's famous [Party Sheet](https://github.com/maxstar/forbidden-lands-party-sheet) is now part of the system.
-   Stronghold Sheets.
    -   Giving you the ability to track the buildings, hirelings, and resources in a stronghold through drag-and-drop.
-   Items:
    -   Gear — General equipment needed for adventuring.
    -   Weapon — Choose whether it is a normal weapon or an artifact.
    -   Armor — Armor rating, and track how to get your hands on some defense.
    -   Talent — Talents for characters. Helps you survive.
    -   Spells — Store information on powerful spells.

    -   Monster Attacks — For detailing vicious monster attacks causing critical injuries.
    -   Monster Talents — Monsters also have talents.

    -   Stronghold Buildings — For ease of tracking the buildings in your stronghold.
    -   Stronghold Hirelings — Track wages, and capabilities of your stronghold's hirelings.
    -   Roll Modifiers can be customized on many items so you don't need to remember whether something gives you a bonus, or penalty, to your rolls.
